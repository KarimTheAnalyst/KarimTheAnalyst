## Manufacturing / R&D Data Analyst

I am a Manufacturing / R&D Data Analyst with a background in physics, industrial R&D, and complex electronics manufacturing environments (including HDI PCB).  
I focus on using data to improve **quality, yield, process stability, and cost** in manufacturing operations.


### Core Skills
- SQL (PostgreSQL): data modeling, staging tables, root cause analysis
- Excel & Power Query: data cleaning, transformation, KPI analysis
- Power BI: manufacturing dashboards, quality & yield monitoring
- Manufacturing analytics: defect analysis, scrap & rework, process improvement

###  Domain Experience
- Electronics manufacturing (HDI PCB as a high-complexity example)
- Quality & reliability analysis
- Process optimization in production and R&D environments



###  Featured Projects
- **Root Cause Analysis in Manufacturing (SQL / PostgreSQL)** – defect drivers, yield impact, and cost analysis (HDI PCB case)
- **Manufacturing KPI Dashboard (Power BI)** – executive and operational views (HDI PCB case)
